## Persistence Wins

Persistent, consistent, and frequent stories, delivered to an aligned audience, will earn attention, trust, and action.

## Ten Things Good Stories Do

Bernadette shares ten things that good stories do; if the story you’re telling yourself (and others) doesn’t do these things for you, you might need to dig deeper and find a better story, one that’s more true and more effective. Good stories:

1. Connect us to our purpose and vision for our career or business. 
1. Allow us to celebrate our strengths by remembering how we got from there to here. 
1. Deepen our understanding of our unique value and what differentiates us in the marketplace. 
1. Reinforce our core values. 
1. Help us to act in alignment and make value-based decisions. 
1. Encourage us to respond to customers instead of react to the marketplace. 
1. Attract customers who want to support businesses that reflect or represent their values. 
1. Build brand loyalty and give customers a story to tell. 
1. Attract the kind of like-minded employees we want. 
1. Help us to stay motivated and continue to do work we’re proud of

## Sharing Your Story

Three Step Narrative for Action: Story of Self, Story of Us, Story of Now.

* Story of self is your chance to explain that you are people like us. That you did things like this. That your actions led to a change, one we can hear and see and understand.
* Story of us is about together, not apart. It explains why your story of self is relevant to us, and how we will benefit when we’re part of people like us.
* Story of now enlists the tribe on your journey. It’s the peer opportunity/peer pressure of the tribe that will provide the tension for all of us to move forward, together.

1. In the first paragraph, we hear the story of our friend, a narrative of going from here to there.
2. In the second, we hear about how it changes our friend’s relationships, including to people like us. 
3. In the third, there’s a call to action, a reason to do something right now.

## Understanding Your Tribe

From Seth Godin's _This is Marketing_:
1. Who’s it for?
1. What’s it for?
1. What is the worldview of the audience you’re seeking to reach?
1. What are they afraid of?
1. What story will you tell?
1. Is it true?
1. What change are you seeking to make?
1. How will it change their status?
1. How will you reach the early adopters and neophiliacs?
1. Why will they tell their friends?
1. What will they tell their friends?
1. Where’s the network effect that will propel this forward?
1. What asset are you building?
1. Are you proud of it?

## Undoing Saul's _Rules for Radicals_

From Seth Godin's _This is Marketing_:

* “Put people to work. It’s even more effective than money.”
* “Challenge your people to explore, to learn, and to get comfortable with uncertainty.”
* “Find ways to help others on the path find firm footing.”
* “Help others write rules that allow them to achieve their goals.”
* “Treat the others the way you’d want to be treated.”
* “Don’t criticize for fun. Do it when it helps educate, even if it’s not entertaining.”
* “Stick with your tactics long after everyone else is bored with them. Only stop when they stop working.”
* “It’s okay to let the pressure cease now and then. People will pay attention to you and the change you seek when they are unable to consistently ignore it.”
* “Don’t make threats. Do or don’t do.”
* “Build a team with the capacity and the patience to do the work that needs doing.”
* “If you bring your positive ideas to the fore, again and again, you’ll raise the bar for everyone else.”
* “Solve your own problems before you spend a lot of time finding problems for the others.”
* “Celebrate your people, free them to do even more, make it about the cohort, and invite everyone along. Disagree with institutions, not with people.”
