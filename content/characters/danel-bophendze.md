Danel Bophendze is a legendary Imperal Postal Marine. For him, life is a struggle against chaos and insanity. Others say he is best known for the Battle of Tannenburg Gate. When people first meet him, they notice his strong military bearing, friendliness and drive to get the best out of others, then they notice that he is given to wide ranges of negative emotion and reckless behavior. Because of the abandonment by his father and motherâ€™s family, and his mother's death, he needs to prove restraint is for the coward. He fears that he will be exposed as a fraud and will risk everything to prevent it.
