<p>I chose my thoughts.
  I know that doing my best starts with thinking my best.
  Like laying down a path for an adventure, these thoughts set the course for my actions.
</p>

<p>I am confident in what I think matters.
  I am excited to see what happens next.
  I am disciplined and dedicated to stick with it.</p>

<p>Here are 10 things I know:</p>

<ol class="leading-tight">
  <li>Today is brand new. Tomorrow is, too.</li>
  <li>I have a gift worth giving (I have a voice and a right to be heard)</li>
  <li>The only person standing in my way is me. I quit doing that yesterday</li>
  <li>God is my boss, and he is the best boss.</li>
  <li>Winning is contagious. When I help others win, I win, too.</li>
  <li>Feeling uncomfortable is just a sign that my old comfort zone is having a hard time keeping up with me.</li>
  <li>Momentum is messy. Progress is the goal. Complexity the bridge. Simplicity the destination.</li>
  <li>All things work together for good to those who love God.</li>
  <li>I am my biggest fan.</li>
  <li>The best response to obstacles is to do it anyway.</li>
</ol>

<p id="morning">
  I've pulled the slingshot back.
  I am not <em>leaving</em> this room.
  I am <em>launching</em> from it, ready for a day full of untold opportunities.
  I've packed honesty, generosity, laughter and bravery for the road ahead.
</p>
<p id="evening">
  What a day.
  The best part is I left myself a lot of fun things to work on tomorrow.
  WHen my head hits that pillow, I'm off the clock, storing up energy and excitement for a brand-new day.
