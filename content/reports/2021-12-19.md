This was a slow week. Worked to plot Chapter 4. Contemplating background development for the setting.

Also put some time into prepping the key supporting business files. This includes the 2021 finances and business plan.

Ran across a review of the Wheel of a Time that helps contrast my value proposition:

This series isn't about getting to the climax as fast as possible. These aren't plane ride or beach day books. This is a series for fantasy fans who want the minutia. For those who revel in being able to visualize every single detail of the world. These are for people who want to escape their mundane worlds for some time and live in another, more fantastical world.
If that's what you're looking for in a fantasy series then that is what Wheel of Time offers in droves.
To those who say that this series is just generic fantasy, you're right. But, man, it's wrapped in a brilliant packaging. I would say this is the generic fantasy trope (chosen one destined to defeat big bad) done the best it could possibly be done. It's a beautifully realized world in every way.
I think people are really hard on this series. It does what it sets out to do and does it brilliantly.
