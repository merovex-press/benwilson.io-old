Over the past week, I made good progress with Maltuseblon Gambit, nee Luctation. I completed 7,537 words and started the last scene of Chapter 4. This chapter ends a the novel's mid-point. I would say I am 1000 words behind my goal. My ambition is for Gambit to be drafted by 28 February. If I could sustain a chapter per week, I would be finished by 31 January. Given my inconsistency, I am staying with the February date.

I did manage to fart around with the side tools that last Sunday I deemed complete. However, I am now able to look at where in Terradoma the characters are, and where they are going next. Since Gambit is a chase story, this was important.

I tinkered a bit with PWA and Atticus, to see if Atticus is ready for prime time. At present, it is limited because of the lack of integrity between exports. The key among them is the inability to carry monospace fonts between Atticus and PWA and Word. This means formatting must come last, where my normal process has been to format as I go and trust the compiler.

This week, I should finish Chapter 4, do a by-scene plot of Chapter 5 and get well into the chapter. My plan is a chapter every two weeks, where I plot the chapter at the beginning of the period. I will also PWA Chapters 3 and 4 so they are close enough to release.
