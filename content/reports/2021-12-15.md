I started using Story Origin to track my progress on 6 December. Through to 13 December, I added 6,519 words to Maltuseblan Gambit (renamed from Luctation). I'm at the cusp of finishing chapter 3. I need to plot Chapter 4 this week and get it moving. Having a general overview then plotting by chapter seems to be going well.

I started going down the rebranding track by engaging a cover artist. We chatted through 5 December, not sure I included this in the prior update. I should ping him again soon, but I'm in no hurry there.

I struggled over the name, which led to a lot of changes on that front by renaming all the books. I was being sort of cute with the earlier names.
