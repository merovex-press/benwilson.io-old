Craig Martelle finished his 366th 5-minute focus videos, an apparent target for conclusion. In a video this week, he shared a bit about his writing style and length of his novels. He and I are in the same genre, and he previously said he keeps his book lengths down since the sales unit is the book not the word. I was targeting 85,000 words, which is the upper boundary of his writing (75-85,000 words). Because of this, I am reducing my book length target to 75,000 words.

Over the past week, I wrote 4,700 words over a span of roughly 5 hours; 920 words per hour. During this time, I spent another 4.7 hours on Visual Studio Code, which loosely translates to time spent fooling with the website. By contrast, I spent 12 hours playing Civilization, and 7 hours playing World of Tanks. My goal is at least 7 hours writing each week. I hit my goal (one hour per day) on Tuesday and Saturday. 

See http://benwilson.io/tools/writing-progress/ for progress.

Writing statistics come from Scrivener. Time statistics come from RescueTime, which has tracked my computer time fairly well over the past 11 years. For example, it appears I play WoT an average of 300 hours per year. This averages to about 6 hours per week. I left out 2019 & 2020 from the average.

The two distractors this past week include a potential relocation of the website from AWS Amplify to Cloudflare. I reversed that decision this while writing this, which is largely correcting the AWS name servers. I later learned that Cloudflare is unabashedly woke. It's a shame, as it has a better offering. A second distractor was playing with the writing progress javascript (linked above). I added some forecasting, which indicates I am about 2,000 words behind target. This was a mildly distracting activity since I now have some predictive capability. If I keep writing at pace, I can finish by April, though my target is June. The problem is I don't write at pace.

I had a migraine on 16 January, either caused by the weather, or gumbo soup. Weather migraines don't start with vision loss, but food additives do. I medicated well, so I only felt lethargic and blind for about six hours. This sucks, since I had a four day weekend set aside to write.

Lastly, in looking at my writing progress, it seems that an error crept in. Scrivener gave me higher word counts than what I thought I produced for some days, and captured writing on days I missed. Rather than go back to correct the record, I adjusted for the week I am reporting on.

Simple goal this week: one hour per day for every day through Sunday. On non-work days, I would like to score 2 hours per day. I think I need to re-read Atomic Habits this week.
