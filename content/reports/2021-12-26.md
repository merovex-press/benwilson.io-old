Over the past week, I was on vacation. Considering readers of the space marine genre should care about technical precision, my prior reliance on fudgy units of measure (a mile representing .11 AU, referring to travel time in miles per cycle, etc.), I spent the better part of the week improving precision.

* I opted to use Traveler 5e (Fifth edition) as the basis for a lot of the calculations. I've owned the rule book since 2012, and there was some supporting information online.
* Completed the Travel Time Calculator
* Re-hosted/restored the UWP Translator
* Created the Weekly Progress graph
* Created the Postal Marines Volume Report
* Rehosted the site to https://benwilson.io.

As for actual writing, I stubbed out the plot for Chapter 4. This requires me to add a scene in Chapter 3, and clean up some of the organization of the overall section. I started writing the scene this afternoon before there was an impromptu planning meeting that went awry.

My goal for the next week is to draft Chapter 4 and run it through PWA. It would be great if I plotted Chapter 5 as well. I also want to move the public part of the canon to a sub-domain of benwilson.io. That could be time consuming, so if I get these two tasks done I'll add it as a treat. But, the reason for moving this stuff into the Scrivener project was to stop tool tinkering.
