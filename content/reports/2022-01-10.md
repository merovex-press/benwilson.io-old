This was an under-productive week in terms of content creation. I completed some key business work, and continued to shave the yak.

## Content:

* Completed 1,967 words (2 scenes) in Gambit. The target for a week is about 7,000.
* Outlined Chapter 5, which I would like to complete by 17 January.
* Spent 4.2h on Scrivener, which would be good except I spent 9.3h on Visual Studio (website). I need to stop shaving the yak with the website.
* Drafted a newsletter campaign signaling the transition.

## Business:

* Paid the deposit to the cover artist to start work in the May/July timeframe. (logged on spreadsheet)
* Registered & Paid for 20 Books Vegas 2022. Looks like I'll be going solo this year. Just me and dozens of solo romance writers. (logged on spreadsheet with hotel deposit)
* Email Newsletter
* Transitioned my email recipients from Mailchimp to MailerLite, this included some webpage work.
* Sent email campaign to 31 recipients, one hard bounce was removed
* Drafted automated newsletter campaign to feed off of RSS, which I will activate on 13 February. This is six weeks after the current newsletter (roughly), so it will align to my planned release cycle

## Yak Shaving:

* I tinkered with the idea of transitioning from Scrivener to Visual Code Studio. Shifting authoring tools is yak shaving. I spent an evening and part of a snow-day on this. Suffice to say I can export from Scrivener to VSC, and from there compile my PDFs...which I could already do.
* Website Yak Shaving:
  * DRY-d up the theme template for my website.
  * Transitioned from Source Sans Pro / Source Serif Pro to Source Sans 3 & Source Serif 4, the current fonts.
  * Fixed the problem with the website not converting to WebP format, which when combined with the font transition raised my PageSpeed results to 100 for all pages on both Mobile and Desktop. This gives lightening-fast delivery of any webpage (down to 1.3 seconds on 3G, which is awesome).
  
## Goal:

* For the week ending 17 January, I would like to finish seven sections. There are seven sections in Chapter 5. Success is completing Chapter 5.
* Read Newsletter Ninja
* Participate in the Amazon Ad Word challenge, which may be premature for me but will expose me to the mindset.
