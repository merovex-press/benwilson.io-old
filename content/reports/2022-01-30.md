Over the past week, I wrote five days adding 4,096 words in about six hours. I finished Chapter 5, and plotted Chapter 6. My goal is 7,000 words per week. Based on my writing pace, that takes about nine hours.

I spent a little time improving my understanding of Scrivener. This led to me running through some TODO's to fix minor known problems with the draft.

I spent a bit of time tinkering with a Haiku-based name generator. This helps naming ships and possibly characters. Scripting it was fast, it was converting the terms to Esperanto, which is the linguistic basis for naming in the series.

I added a stationary orbit calculator, which took a bit of reverse engineering. This helps calculate travel times from the surface to orbitals.

My goal for the next week is add 7,000 words to Chapter 6. The chapter should be about 10,000 words long, so I will unlikely finish it this week. My trackers indicate I am behind schedule by 1,500 words (2 hours). I have about 32 hours left in this draft. My ambition is to finish this draft by 28 February and turn to the next book. If I write every day, I may wrap up by 26 February.
