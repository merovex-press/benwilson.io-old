**Progress.** I am a couple days late on the reply due to a distraction. That said, I added 3,210 words over three hours of writing. While I am self-tracking, I also keep the numbers in StoryOrigin. It looks like I am 70 percent complete with Maltuseblon's Gambit.

**Other work.** There is more to being an author than writing. I need reduce the other work (yak shaving) to 4/5th of my productive week. So, if I spend 4 hours writing, I spend 1 hour doing this stuff.
* Improved the writing progress page on my website to include a spinner for the brief moment there is no dynamic content. I linked a Google Sheet to the page that allows me to make word count updates without having to rebuild the site. The spinner was a guilty pleasure in off-productive time. The Sheet was done after a 1,300 word day.
* Moved author finances into Hurdlr. I started mapping the expense categories in my Google Sheet to Schedule C, but kept running into pages Hurdlr put up that explained how a given category worked. Good marketing on them. Hurdlr has a free-tier that I can use until a profit justifies paying for it.
* Basecamp added a new feature where I can add links as "doors," or panels on the project page. I added several links to the websites I use for finances, newsletters, etc. This should make it easy to manage those links. My prior approach was to either embed the links in the Business Plan document (hard to find), as tabs on my browser (easy to lose) or memory.

**Goals & Aspirations.** My 2022 goal is to write two novels (150-160,000 words combined), revise two others, and release all between 22 September and 3 November. I am 52K into the first 75K novel (70%). My target is to have both new works finished by 30 June 2022. By that time, I should be working with the cover artist. This timing important because page count affects the cover.

To reach this goal, I want to write 7,000 words per week (1,000 wpd). My weekly average is 3,966. At this pace, it will take 19 weeks to finish a 75,000 novel. I would like to finish the current novel (22,673 remaining) by President's Day week so I can camp without guilt the following week with John, and use the rest of February to plot Imbroglio. That requires 1,100 wpd, which is just a few words short of a NaNoWriMo. Consistency is key.

My goal is to write Imbroglio from March to May, which is 815 words per day. My brain is in a fog.

**Newsletter Preparation.** Six months prior to first release (22 March), I need to start building the newsletter past the current 27 members. Which also means I need to check the reader magnet (Smee, a short story pulled from Bellicose) for completeness and get that ready for release. No extra writing required. But, I need to figure out how to automate MailerLite. Providentially, a fellow author who has done this for years published a recipe that might work for me. But, I need to add a page on the author site (/joinme/) to use in book backmatter. I can spend a bit of Saturday afternoons working that.
