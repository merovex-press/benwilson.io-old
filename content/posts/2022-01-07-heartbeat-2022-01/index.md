This article is my first attempt to provide structured periodic udpates. It is inspired by [Basecamp's Heartbeat method](https://world.hey.com/jason/what-s-in-a-heartbeat-4fd72d0e) of providing updates across the company. I have these updates scheduled in my calendar set for every sixth Thursday to be released both as blog article and newsletter.
