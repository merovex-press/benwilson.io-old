As promised, this is the third heartbeat. Every six weeks, I'll send another update as I finish and release the first Postal Marines quartet by 3 November 2022.

**Progress Made.** In January, I announced the Postal Marines relaunch. Since my last update, I finished Maltuseblan's Gambit. All that remains are a few TODO reminders, and tweaks when I do my continuity edit later this year. Three of four books planned for November are done. On to the fourth.

In March, I started re-drafting Imbroglio, the story that inspired the entire Postal Marines series. The first chapter is in the can, and I am a good third of the way through Chapter 2. My approach of lightly plotting the book then plotting each chapter as I encounter it works well, but I lose a day or two when I plot. I would love to plot a chapter and draft it in the same week. Regardless, I am tracking to finish this by end-May, which is my planned completion.

If you are curious to see how things are going, I track my progress on my website. It is a geeky tool pulling from a Google Sheet with custom coded analysis. As time permits, I am making it into its own application. I included a screenshot of the calendar graph below. This shows the days I wrote, and how much I contributed. The [dashboard](/dashboard) adds context.

All this, and I went camping with my youngest son and a group of his friends last weekend. We played airsoft. My old Army training was there, but not the athletic build that accompanied it.

**Plans to next Heartbeat?** When next we meet, I should draft four more chapters in Imbroglio. My engagement with the cover artist starts in May, so one cover should be done (or nearly so).

**Beta Readers?** Earlier, I asked for beta readers. A few of you stepped up, thank you. On advice of council, I'll be holding on sending the works out until later in the year. If you are interested, email me.

**What do you read?** I will wrap up the first quartet of the Postal Marines this year. After that, I have 12 more in the series I could write. I am also looking for a new author or series to read. Let me know what you are interested in, and I'll give it a look.
