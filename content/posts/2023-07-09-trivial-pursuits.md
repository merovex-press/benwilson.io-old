Welcome back, everyone. You may know me as an author. However, of late, I’ve taken a deliberate pause from my usual writing pursuits. This hasn’t been because of a loss of passion, but more about balancing life’s many responsibilities. Work, family, and other commitments have taken center stage, leaving little time for my writing. However, I’m still an author at heart, and I’m excited to share my latest update with you.

It takes a lot of emotional energy to write a novel. My work has taxed my reserves with a fresh set of responsibilities. So I shifted my creative outlet to programming, a hobby I’ve enjoyed since my teenage years. I’ve been working on a few projects, including a web app to help me manage my writing projects. I’ve been learning new technologies, such as Rust, Svelte and GraphQL, to keep my skills sharp. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.

A decade ago, I put together a Traveller RPG sector generator in Ruby that relied on the command line. Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve re-written it so that it’s a desktop application. I’m still putting on the finishing touches, but I’m excited to share it soon. I’ve also returned to my hankering to write a novel-writing and formatting application. I’ve been working on it on and off for years, but the underlying tech stack was never sufficient. Technology has matured in the past year, finally giving me the infrastructure I need to build a product I can stand by. I’m hoping to have a beta version ready by the end of the year.

As we navigate through the complexities of our lives, personal support systems become even more vital. For me, that’s my family. Their unwavering support anchors me through the stormiest of times, providing the strength to handle any challenge that comes my way. They are my reminder of what truly matters in the end.

In conclusion, while my writing might be on a pause, the rest of my life continues in full swing. I am an author finding new perspectives, a project manager leveraging the problem-solving skills honed during my time as a programmer, and, above all, a family man forever grateful for the love and support that anchors me.
