Hello, everyone! If you've been following my journey, you know that I hit the pause button on my writing for about six months. It wasn't an easy decision, but sometimes life throws curveballs that you just can't ignore. Between work, family, and programming Verkilo, my plate was full. But guess what? I'm back, and I couldn't be more excited to pick up where I left off.

First off, let's talk about why I took a break. It wasn't a loss of passion or a creative block. Far from it. Life just got busy. Real busy. Work ramped up, family needed attention, and other commitments couldn't be pushed aside. It was a time for me to pause, pivot, and problem-solve, just like my last post mentioned. And you know what? The break was good for me. It gave me time to recharge and refocus.

During my time off, I did some soul-searching. I asked myself what I wanted to achieve with my writing. The answer? To continue creating worlds that you, my readers, can get lost in. But I also realized that balance is key. I can't ignore the other parts of my life that need attention. So, I've made some changes to my routine to ensure that I can juggle everything effectively.

I've hit the ground running this week, diving back into my ongoing project. I revisited my draft of *Ameliorate*, outlined new ideas, and even tinkering with how I might connect with fellow authors. There's a lot in the pipeline, and I can't wait to share it with you all. Let's just say I have a lot of writing to get done, and not a lot of time to do it. Stay tuned for updates, teasers, and maybe even some sneak peeks.

If there's one thing this break taught me, it's the importance of balance. Writing is a big part of who I am, but it's not the only part. Taking time off allowed me to gain a fresh perspective, not just on my writing but on life in general. It's made me a better writer, a better family man, and honestly, a better person.
