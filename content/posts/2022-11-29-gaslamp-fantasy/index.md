Since I am writing a Gaslamp Fantasy, I thought it was worth a short description of what the genre is, and why the Stranded Series fits the description. My basis for the description comes from the [TV Trope website]().

Gaslamp fantasy is [Steampunk](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk)'s more magically-inclined cousin. The Steampunk genre comprises advanced machines, with steam age tech. Thus, Gaslamp is Steampunk with magic instead of technology. Both tend to also be set in the Regency, Victorian or Edwardian period. While the key distinction is the focus of magic or technology, the genres overlap with [Magitek](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek) (technology uses fantastical magic) and in [Phlebotinum-Induced](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumInducedSteampunk) (fictional power-source) [Steampunk](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumInducedSteampunk). 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is an example of the latter.

The Stranded Series rests right on that line between magic and steampunk. Discovery introduces more modern tech, but it also introduces a fantastic lantern relies on no power obvious source. As the series builds, there are more items that fall into the fantastic. [*The Difference Engine*](https://amzn.to/3G7BOWG) is Steampunk. [*The Grimnoir Chronicles*](https://amzn.to/3XHUDaC) is early 20th Century Fantasy; a little too late for Gaslamp, but with hard magic edges. Stranded relies on Arthur C. Clarke's "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

To a certain degree, both are sub-genres of alternative history. *Grimnoir Chronicles* involves an 1850 departure from the original timeline due to magic.
