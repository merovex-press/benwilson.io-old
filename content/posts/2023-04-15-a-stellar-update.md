It's me, your favorite science-fiction author, reaching out with an update on my writing adventures over the past three months. I apologize for the delay in bringing you this blog post, but rest assured, it's because I've been hard at work creating more out-of-this-world stories for you. So, let's jump right into what I've been up to recently.

In response to your feedback and my own creative calling, I decided to return to our much-loved series, the "Postal Marines." It's been a pleasure revisiting familiar territory and embarking on new adventures with characters both old and new. I am currently crafting a fresh quartet of novels that I'm sure you'll find both exciting and captivating.

This new quartet follows the life and adventures of Litovio, a character who made an appearance in our original quartet featuring the unforgettable Bophendze. Litovio's story promises to be every bit as engaging and enthralling as his predecessor's, with plenty of twists and turns along the way.

In the upcoming novels, we delve into a universe of high-stakes politics, intrigue, and space-faring combat. The tension mounts as our heroes navigate the complexities of diplomacy, betrayal, and the looming specter of war. But don't worry, amidst the excitement and conflict, there will be moments of levity and humor that will lighten the mood and keep you turning the pages.

As I continue working on this new quartet, I feel a sense of excitement and gratitude. Your unwavering support and feedback have been invaluable in guiding my writing, and I'm thrilled to have you on this journey with me. Together, we will explore the depths of the human imagination, venturing where no reader has gone before.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you, my dear readers, for being the driving force behind my passion for storytelling. It is an incredible honor to share these tales with you, and I eagerly anticipate the day when we can embark on the next chapter in the "Postal Marines" saga.

Until then, may the words be with you!
